# HTML, CSS, and Javascript test repo
This is a repository initially created for the Coursera [HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-css-javascript-for-web-developers). Along with the course assignments, I'm using this for all the other HTML\CSS\JS tests.

None of these little projects are useful in any way, shape or form - not that anyone was wondering.
